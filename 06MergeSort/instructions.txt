-Easy version of merge (will make mergesort more complicated)
The function should either take two arrays and merge them, returning a new array.
int[] merge(int[]aryA, int[]aryB)

Preconditions:
The length of each array is at least one.
Each array's has all of its elements in ascending order (sorted)


-Better version (a little more work but will make mergesort much cleaner, because the copying happens here)
The function can take an array, and the start/end indices of each part to be merged. it could then merge into a new array, and copy the results back.
void merge(int[]data, int startA, endA, startB, endB)


Preconditions:
data.length >= 2
the elements of data are in ascending order (sorted)
startA <= endA 
startB <= endB
endA + 1 == startB
startA >= 0
endB < data.length

-Best version:
There is no BEST. 
You can worry about optimizing later. Just make it work, and make it work with mergesort on Thursday.
